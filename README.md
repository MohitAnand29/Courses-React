🚀 Installation & Setup
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/MohitAnand29/Courses-React

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd Courses-React

3. Install the necessary dependencies:
npm install

4. Start the development server:
npm start

The application will now be running on http://localhost:3000.


Usage Guide
Once the application is running, you can:

View all courses displayed by default under the "All" category.

Filter courses by clicking on the category buttons (e.g., "Development", "Business") at the top. The view will dynamically update to show only the courses from the selected category.

Favorite a course by clicking the heart icon on a course card. A success notification will appear. Clicking it again will remove it from favorites, triggering an info notification.

📁 Project Structure
The project follows a standard React application structure, with components organized for clarity and reusability.

src/
├── components/
│   ├── Card.js         # Renders a single course card with like functionality.
│   ├── Cards.js        # Renders the grid of all course cards.
│   ├── Filter.js       # Renders the category filter buttons.
│   ├── Navbar.js       # The main navigation bar.
│   └── Spinner.js      # The loading animation component.
├── App.js              # The main application component, manages state and API calls.
├── data.js             # Contains the API URL and static filter data.
├── index.css           # Global styles and Tailwind CSS configurations.
└── index.js            # The entry point of the React application.

🔮 Future Improvements
Here are some ideas for future enhancements:

Persistent Likes: Use localStorage or a backend to make the "liked" status persist across browser sessions.

Dedicated Favorites Page: Add a new filter category or a separate page to view all liked courses.

Search Functionality: Implement a search bar to find courses by title or keyword.

Accessibility Enhancements: Further improve ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.

Custom Hooks: Refactor the API fetching logic into a custom hook (e.g., useFetchCourses) for cleaner code in App.js.
